# Specification

Quick Specificiation for What We're Building

## Requirements:

- user can submit a form specifying a username
- user gets a generated url to a page that displays their last-fm data
- there is no requirement for persistence
- asyncronous data fetching from last.fm
- handle case where there is less that 20 albums.
- ensure images are loaded: https://www.javascriptstuff.com/detect-image-load/
- more responsive design, keeping the basic idea
- close button on drawer

## Nice to haves:

- flip the cards ? Might be doable.
- a visual of the percentage of total listens this album represents
- spinners on data loading: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-css-spinners

## Testing:

- test the components, data fetching and form
- figure out where state needs to live
